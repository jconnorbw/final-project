# final-project

This is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that creates a Professional Website for the CS 563 - Intro to Web Development course at Portland State University. This Professional Website consists of an About, Previous Work, Projects, and Contact section, all of which can be navigated to with an implemented Navbar. The index.html file is the website's homepage and the website is run through it. The About section introduces myself and my professional experience. The Previous Work section outlines my previous work and experience. The Projects section describes projects I have previously worked on. The Contact section includes a contact form, which outputs inputted information in a console.log format through JavaScript.

This Professional Website is deployed at https://jconnorbw.github.io/final-project/
