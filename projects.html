        The below projects were all completed through the Computer Science
        program at Portland State University (PSU) and portray a journey of
        growth from beginning to end before joining PSU's Computer Science
        Master's program.

        <p class="project-info">
          Implemented using Python, this program runs the game Coin War
          (two-player game inspired by the card game War), which plays two
          armies of coins against each other until one is left standing or both
          tie. Armies are defined by a list of five coins flipped to either
          side; heads or tails. The purpose of this project was to apply our
          beginning knowledge of Python to a fun game.

          Implemented using C++, this application allows a user to manage
          different collections of athletes competing in specific competitions
          in the Winter Olympics. This application will allow a user to add,
          search for, and display athlete information and their competition
          statistics. The purpose of this application was to test and use
          operator overloading to achieve managing these three different types
          of athletes.

          Implemented using Java, this project allows a user to build a menu of
          food items and then subsequently order food from that menu. A user can
          also load food items directly into a menu from an externai text file.
          Users can add, search, remove, and edit food item attributes. The
          purpose of these final projects were to immerse ourselves into using a
          new program, Java, after using C++ the entire term. It pushed us to
          learn a new language fast, using the skills we gained along the way.
